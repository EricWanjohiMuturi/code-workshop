# Full-Stack Workshop: Learning + Real Projects (Vue · FastAPI · Kotlin)

## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to my Advent of Code Learning Lab — a personal journey where I solve daily AoC challenges while sharpening my skills in Vue, FastAPI, and Kotlin.

This repository is more than just solutions: it’s a growth space, a playground, and a roadmap for building real-world projects based on what I learn along the way.

My goals with this repo are:

1. 🚀 Strengthen my frontend skills with Vue through interactive visualizations of AoC problems.

2. ⚡ Build fast, scalable backend APIs using FastAPI, turning some challenge solutions into reusable services.

3. 🧠 Learn Kotlin from scratch, applying it to algorithmic puzzles and backend experiments.

4. 🧩 Go beyond Advent of Code — transforming insights into actual applications, utilities, and mini-projects.

Whether you're following along, learning these technologies, or just curious, feel free to explore, fork, or contribute.
Let’s build, break, and learn — one challenge at a time.

## 🎯 Goals & Learning Path
1. Vue (Frontend)

Build interactive components 

Experiment with composables, state management, and routing

Create small front-end tools inspired by AoC challenges

2. FastAPI (Backend)

Wrap some AoC solutions in API endpoints

Explore async Python, background tasks, dependency injection

Build microservices that can be reused later in personal projects

3. Kotlin (New Language)

Learn basics through AoC problems

Explore Kotlin data structures

Eventually try building a small backend or CLI tool with Ktor

## 📜 Why This Repo Exists

I believe the best way to learn is by building consistently, solving real problems, and expanding every challenge into something bigger. AoC gives me structured daily problems; this repo gives me space to turn them into projects, APIs, visual demos, and learning journeys.
